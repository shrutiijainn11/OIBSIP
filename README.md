Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks (Domain: Data Science)

## Overview
This repository contains the work and projects completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP). It includes various assignments, projects, and practical exercises that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in software development and data science.

## Features
- **Internship Assignments**: Detailed documentation of tasks and exercises from the internship.
- **Projects**: Implementation of projects assigned during the internship.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of each project phase and task.
- **Code Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts with code, analysis, and explanations.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and documenting code.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification
- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
- **Goal**: Classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on the given features.
- **Techniques**: Common algorithms include k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis
- **Dataset**: Unemployment data typically includes features like age, gender, education level, work experience, and regional economic indicators.
- **Goal**: Analyze and predict unemployment rates, identify trends, and determine factors influencing unemployment.
- **Techniques**: Time series analysis, regression models, clustering, and machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared for predictive models; visualizations for trend analysis.

## 3. Car Price Prediction
- **Dataset**: Car sales data with features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and price.
- **Goal**: Predict the selling price of a car based on its features.
- **Techniques**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and cross-validation for model performance.

## 4. Email Spam Detection
- **Dataset**: Email data with features including email text, metadata (sender, subject, etc.), and a binary label (spam or not spam).
- **Goal**: Classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).
- **Techniques**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 5. Sales Prediction
- **Dataset**: Sales data with features like date, product details, store information, promotions, and historical sales.
- **Goal**: Predict future sales for a product or store.
- **Techniques**: Time series forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA), regression models, ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and Neural Networks (LSTM).
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and cross-validation for model performance.
