# OIBSIP
Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks (Domain: Data Science)

## Overview
This repository contains the work and projects completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP). It includes various assignments, projects, and practical exercises that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in software development and data science.

## Features
- **Internship Assignments**: Detailed documentation of tasks and exercises from the internship.
- **Projects**: Implementation of projects assigned during the internship.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of each project phase and task.
- **Code Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts with code, analysis, and explanations.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and documenting code.

## 1. Iris Flower Classification
- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
- **Goal**: Classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on the given features.
- **Techniques**: Common algorithms include k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate model performance.
